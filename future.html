    <h1>Welcome To My Future Plans Page</h1>
    <h4>Building off of my previous experiences, my future plans consist of biomedical engineering, computer science, and business.</h4>
    <h3>Future Major</h3>
    <p>I plan to double major in biomedical engineering and computer science, and minor in business.</p>
    <p>My interest in biomedical engineering stems from my structural biology research and robotics team. While completing my research, I was in awe at the technical tools that allowed us to visualize individual amino acid chains like AlphaFold or design sequences of DNA like SnapGene.</p>
    <p>These tools allowed us to advance our research, and in order to support future scientific discovery, the tools created must also equally advance. Because of my interest in biological research and engineering principles learned in robotics, I would like to play a role in developing these vital technologies to advance scientific research.</p>
    <h4>Potential areas of interest in biomedical engineering include:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Biocomputation</li>
      <li>Tissue Engineering</li>
      <li>Neural Engineering</li>
      <li>Medical Device Development</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Future School</h3>
    <p>I am currently in the college application process, so the school I will be attending next year is still unknown. However, there are several schools that I am interested in attending. My top three schools are listed below as well as the components that attract me to each school.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Duke University
        <ul>
          <li>I know this might seem overrated, but when I toured the campus, I truly felt like I was at my second home.</li>
          <li>I love the students passion for athletics. As a student who has never experienced a football game or any high spiritred sports game, Duke would show me the "rah rah" of sports.</li>
          <li>Duke also has one of the strongest biomed programs in the country, and their research in tissue engineering is fascinating.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>University of Illinois Urbana Champaign
        <ul>
          <li>This school is close to home, so on days when I'm really missing my family, they're only a short drive away and not an entire plane ride.</li>
          <li>UIUC also has one of the strongest computer science programs in the country that top companies like Amazon, google, or meta, higher from directly.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>University of Michigan - Ann Arbor
        <ul>
          <li>Once again, the football spirit will be unmatched, and as someone who lives for sports, I can't wait to experience the robust camraderie while Mr.Brightside plays through the stadium speakers.</li>
          <li>I am looking forward to joining a sorority and Michigan houses an excellent Greek life.</li>
          <li>The alumni network at Michigan is incredible, and the alumni obviously love the school.</li>
          <li>Michigan also offers one of the strongest business and engineering schools.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>I don't know exactly where the future will take me and what I'll be able to accomplish, but I hope that along the way, I'm able to build long lasting friendships, enjoy memorable experiences, and most importantly, be happy.</p>
